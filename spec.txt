Core Requirements / Tasks
1. [+] The builder can add and remove choices from the list of choices. In the visual spec provided, the builder adds and removes choices in a textarea element. Individual items are separated by a new line. Feel free to modify this interaction to meet the requirement of being able to add and remove choices.
2. [+] Validate the following rules and notify the builder if there are any validation issues.
    +The Label field is required.
    +Duplicates choices are not allowed.
    +There cannot be more than 50 choices total.
3. [+] If the default value is not one of the choices, it should be added to the list of choices when the field is saved.
4. [+] For the purpose of the demo, you may want the form to keep its values after the form is submitted. This helps demonstrate the prior requirement (that the default value is added).
5. [+]Add a button that allows the builder to clear the form and start fresh.
6. [+] Generate an HTTP endpoint - either use a free third-party service, or spin up your own local http server.
7. [+] The submit button should create a json object and post it to the endpoint that you generated in your http server above. It should also log the post data to the console. You can add a function to FieldService in MockFieldService.js to accomplish this, but everything is up to you. Feel free to modify or change anything you would like as long as it meets the minimum requirement of posting json data to the back-end endpoint.

Stretch Tasks
1. [+]Add some unit tests using Jest, React testing library or similar 

2. [+]Allow the form to be responsive and work on mobile devices in addition to desktop.

3. Have you ever closed the browser accidentally when working on something? Yeah, me too. Let's help the user out by populating the form with the input they were working on if they accidentally close the browser.

4. [+]The database that stores this does not allow individual choices in the list of choices to be longer than 40 characters. Add client-side validation such that excess characters are visually distinct if the choice is longer than 40 characters. I.e., if a user enters the word that is longer than 40 characters, the characters above 40 would be highlighted in red.

5. [+]Refactor the button component such that it could be used by other developers and maintain the same style and behavior (e.g., for a custom component library). For example, let's say we want all of our submit buttons to show a loading indicator after they are clicked. How could we create a component that has that behavior that would be shared across all instances of the submit button?
